# Bayesian-Classification-Machine-Learning
Naïve Bayesian classifier that can read a movie review and decide, if the review author would rate the movie as positive or negativebased on the text entered.
Task1(splitting and counting the reviews, 8 points)Create a function that reads the file and separates it into training data and evaluation data based on the split indicator. The function should return four lists:-Training data, containing all reviews of the training set[1 point]-Training labels, containing all associated sentiment labels for the training data[1 point]Machine LearningAssignment 1: Bayesian Classification
-Test data, containing all reviews of the test set[1 point]-Test labels, containing all associated sentiment labels for the test data[1 point]Further to that, the function should print on the console-the number of positive reviews in the training set[1 point]-the number of negative reviews in the training set[1 point]-the number of positive reviews in the evaluation set[1 point]-the number of negative reviews in the evaluation set[1 point]Task2(extract relevant features, 5 points)Create a function that goes through allreviewsin the training data extracted in task 1.Some of the reviews contain non-alphanumeric (e.g. “.”, “,”, “!”, etc.) characters that should be removedbefore processing. Remove all such extra charactersfrom the reviews[1 point], convert the reviews to lower case [1 point]and split the review content into individual words[1 point].Now count the number of occurrences of each word in the training set[1 point]. The function should take the data set(i.e. the training data constructed in task 1) as input parameter. Further to that, it should have an input parameter for specifying the minimum word length and the minimum number of word occurrence. Using this mapping of words to number of occurrences in the training set, extract all the wordsfrom the reviews that meet these minimum requirements[1 point]. The function should return these words as list.Task3(count feature frequencies, 2 points)Use the function created in task 2 to extract the set of all words of a minimum length and with a minimum number of occurrences from the reviews in the trainingset.Now create a function that goes through all positive reviews in the training setand counts for each of these words the number of reviewsthe word appears in[1 point]. Do the same for all negative reviewsas well[1 point].The function should take the review setto be searchedand the set of words to look for as input parameters and should return as output a dictionary that mapseach word of the input set tothe number of reviewsthe wordoccurred inin the input set.If a word is not foundin any review in the input set it should map to 0.Task 4(calculate feature likelihoodsand priors, 2 points)Consider each word extracted in task2as a binary feature of a reviewindicating that a word is either present in the review or absent in the review. Using the function created in task 3 to count the number of reviews each of these features is present incalculate the likelihoods𝑃[𝑤𝑜𝑟𝑑𝑖𝑠𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑟𝑒𝑣𝑖𝑒𝑤|𝑟𝑒𝑣𝑖𝑒𝑤𝑖𝑠𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒]
and𝑃[𝑤𝑜𝑟𝑑𝑖𝑠𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑟𝑒𝑣𝑖𝑒𝑤|𝑟𝑒𝑣𝑖𝑒𝑤𝑖𝑠𝑛𝑒𝑔𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒]for each word in the feature vector.Create a function that calculates these likelihoods for all words applying Laplace smoothingwith a smoothing factor 𝛼=1[1 point]. The function should take the two mappingscreated in task 3andthe total number of positive/negative reviews obtained in task 1 as input and return a dictionary mapping each feature word to the likelihood probabilitythat a word is present in a review given its class being either positive or negative.Also calculate the priors𝑃[𝑟𝑒𝑣𝑖𝑒𝑤𝑖𝑠𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒]and𝑃[𝑟𝑒𝑣𝑖𝑒𝑤𝑖𝑠𝑛𝑒𝑔𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒]by considering the fraction of positive/negative reviews in the training set[1 point].Task 5 (maximum likelihood classification, 2 points)Use the likelihood functions and priors created in task 4 to now create a Naïve Bayes classifier forpredictingthe sentiment label for a new review text[2 points]. Remember to use logarithms of the probabilities for numerical stability.The function should take as input the new review text as string as well as the priors and likelihoods calculated in task 4. It should produce as output the predicted sentiment label for the new review (i.e. either “positive” or “negative”).Task 6 (evaluationof results, 11 points)Create a k-fold cross-validation procedure for splittingthe training set into k folds and train the classifier created in tasks 2-5 on the training subset[1 point]. Evaluate the classification accuracy, i.e. the fraction of correctly classifier samples, on the evaluation subset [1 point]and use this procedure to calculate the mean accuracy score[1 point].Compare different accuracy scores for different choices (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10) of the word length parameter as defined in task 2[1 point]. Select the optimal word length parameter [1 point]and evaluate the resulting classifier on the test set extracted in task 1.The final evaluation should contain:
-The confusion matrix for the classification[1 point]-The percentage of true positive[1 point], true negatives[1 point], false positives[1 point]and false negatives[1 point]-The classification accuracy score, i.e. the fraction of correctly classified samples[1 point]Task 7 (optional, no marks)Choose a movie you like and a movie you hate and write a review for both. Try the classifier on your review and see if the predicted sentiment score matches your own sentiment
